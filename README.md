Purpose / Problem
 Design and simulate a digital elevator control system capable of navigating multiple floors, processing binary inputs, and responding correctly to complex operational scenarios.
Your Role
 Designed and implemented the complete elevator control logic in Verilog, including state machine architecture, input handling, and system verification.
Technical Details
Developed a multi-state finite state machine to control elevator movement, floor selection, and direction logic


Modeled floor navigation using binary number operations to represent and compare floor positions


Implemented control logic to handle multiple input scenarios, including sequential floor requests and direction changes


Designed combinational and sequential logic blocks to ensure correct timing and state transitions


Created comprehensive testbenches to validate system behavior across normal and edge-case operating conditions
